//! Constants for use in connection URLs.
//!
//! Database connections are initialized with an instance of [`ConnectParams`](crate::ConnectParams).
//! Instances of [`ConnectParams`](crate::ConnectParams)
//! can be created using a [`ConnectParamsBuilder`](crate::ConnectParamsBuilder), or from a URL.
//! (Also [`ConnectParamsBuilder`](crate::ConnectParamsBuilder)s can be created from a URL.)
//!  
//! Such a URL is supposed to have the form
//!
//! ```text
//! <scheme>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>[<options>]
//! ```
//! where
//! > `<scheme>` = `hdbsql` | `hdbsqls`  // for TCP or TLS connections, respectively\
//! > `<username>` = the name of the DB user to log on\
//! > `<password>` = the password of the DB user\
//! > `<host>` = the host where HANA can be found\
//! > `<port>` = the port at which HANA can be found on `<host>`\
//! > `<options>` = `?<key>[=<value>][{&<key>[=<value>]}]`  
//!
//! __Supported options are:__
//! - `db=<databasename>` specifies the (MDC) database to which you want to connect  
//! - `client_locale=<value>` is used in language-dependent handling within the
//!   SAP HANA database calculation engine
//! - `client_locale_from_env` (no value) lets the driver read the client's locale from the
//!   environment variabe LANG
//! - `<networkgroup>` = a network group
//! - `no_compression` disables the support for compression
//! - the [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) options:
// FIXME not only pem files!!
//!   - `tls_certificate_dir=<value>` points to a folder with pem files that contain
//!     certificates; all pem files in that folder are evaluated  
//!   - `tls_certificate_env=<value>` denotes an environment variable that contains
//!     certificates  
//!   - `use_mozillas_root_certificates` (no value) lets the driver use the root certificates from
//!     [`https://mkcert.org/`](https://mkcert.org/)  
//!   - `insecure_omit_server_certificate_check` (no value) lets the driver omit the validation of
//!     the server's identity. Don't use this option in productive setups!  
//!
//! __To configure TLS__, use the scheme `hdbsqls` and at least one of the TLS options.
//!
//! __For a plain connection without TLS__, use the scheme `hdbsql` and none of the TLS options.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! `ConnectParams` is immutable, the URL must contain all necessary information:
//! ```rust
//! use hdbconnect::IntoConnectParams;
//!
//! let conn_params = "hdbsql://my_user:my_passwd@the_host:2222"
//!     .into_connect_params()
//!     .unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! `ConnectParamsBuilder` allows modifications before being converted into a `ConnectParams`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hdbconnect::ConnectParamsBuilder;
//! let conn_params = ConnectParamsBuilder::from("hdbsql://my_user@the_host:2222")
//!     .unwrap()
//!     .with_password("no-secrets-in-urls")
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//! ```
