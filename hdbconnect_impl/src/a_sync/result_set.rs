    /// A result set is essentially a two-dimensional structure, given as a list
    /// of rows, where each row is a list of fields; the name of each field is
    /// given in the metadata of the result set.
    ///
    /// The method supports a variety of target data structures, with the only
    /// strong limitation that no data loss is supported.
    ///
    /// It depends on the dimension of the result set what target data
    /// structure   you can choose for deserialization:
    ///
    /// * You can always use a `Vec<line_struct>`, if the elements of
    ///   `line_struct` match the field list of the result set.
    ///
    /// * If the result set contains only a single line (e.g. because you
    ///   specified `TOP 1` in your select clause),
    ///   then you can optionally choose to deserialize directly into a plain
    ///   `line_struct`.
    ///
    /// * If the result set contains only a single column, then you can
    ///   optionally choose to deserialize directly into a
    ///   `Vec<plain_field>`.
    ///
    /// * If the result set contains only a single value (one row with one
    ///   column), then you can optionally choose to deserialize into a
    ///   plain `line_struct`, or a `Vec<plain_field>`, or a `plain_field`.
    ///
    /// Also the translation of the individual field values provides flexibility.
    ///
    /// * You can e.g. convert values from a nullable column
    ///   into a plain field, provided that no NULL values are given in the
    ///   result set.
    ///
    /// * Vice versa, you can use an `Option<plain_field>`, even if the column is
    ///   marked as NOT NULL.
    ///
    /// * Similarly, integer types can differ, as long as the concrete values
    ///   can be assigned without loss.
    ///
