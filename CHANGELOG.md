# Changelog

## [0.32.0-unreleased] 2025-06-??

Remove dependency on `ring` completely.

Add some convenience methods to `ConnectParamsBuilder`.

Add `examples/setup_db_for_tests.rs` to set up a test configuration.

Add some code to `connect_options.rs` to avoid ugly warnings (a left-over FIXME is also added).

Update to edition 2024 and to rust-version to 1.85.

## [0.31.0] 2025-02-19

Remove ``initialize_crypto``. We use rustls as is. You can configure a non-default behavior of
`rustls` with
[install_default](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html#method.install_default)
(1).

Merge `HdbError` variants `Usage` and `UsageDetailed`, as well as `Impl` and `ImplDetailed`,
new variants `Usage` and `Impl` are based on `Cow`.

Increase MSRV to 1.80, due to update of `bb8` (2).

Version bump due to (1) and (2).

## [0.30.1] 2024-12-11

Add method `ConnectParamsBuilder::to_url_with_password()`.

## [0.30.0] 2024-11-29

Improve handling of `ExecutionResults`.

Fix wrong sequence of entries in HdbResponse.

Remove `ConnectParamsBuilder::to_url()` (use `ConnectParamsBuilder::to_url_without_password()`
instead).

## [0.29.1] 2024-11-20

Add `ConnectParamsBuilder::to_url_without_password()`.
Deprecate `ConnectParamsBuilder::to_url()`.

## [0.29.0] 2024-10-23

Add `hdbconnect(_async)::initialize_crypto()` to allow reliable rustls initialization without
direct dependency to `rustls`.

Switch to `serde_db` `0.12` and adopt its improved naming (-> version bump).

Remove Tls from public API, as it is not needed there.

## [0.28.7] 2024-10-09

Fix implementation of url-option "insecure_omit_server_certificate_check".

## [0.28.6] 2024-06-12

Allow `HdbValue::NULL` to deserialize into String (as `"<NULL>"`).

Add some Clone implementations.

Allow configuring the cursor holdability.

Further minor improvements.

## [0.28.5] 2024-02-09

Add `bb8` pool for `hdbconnect_async`.

Add `ConnectParamsBuilder::from(url)`.

## [0.28.4] 2024-02-05

### New capabilities

Introduce a configurable read timeout. A set timeout prevents that the driver waits
indefinitely on a response from HANA.

Safely disable further use of a connection after an error during a roundtrip.

## [0.28.3] 2024-01-25

Code maintenance

## [0.28.2] 2024-01-19

### Improvements

Fix issue in CLob.

Revise lob reading and buffering.

Add two HdbError variants to better handle connection failures.

Improve code examples.

## [0.28.1] 2024-01-10

Re-introduce some getter methods on `ConnectParamsBuilder`.

## [0.28.0] 2024-01-05

### New capability

`ConnectionConfiguration` can be used to finetune `hdbconnect`.

`ConnectionStatistics` provides some statistics about the use of a concrete connection.

### API changes

The async variant uses tokio's mutex, which has no issue with poisoning.
Many methods of the async variant thus do not need to wrap
their return value into a Result. Those wrappings are now removed.

## [0.27.0] 2023-12-31

### New capability

`hdbconnect` and `hdbconnect_async` now support and use by default the **compression capability** of
the HANA SQL protocol for large requests and responses.

### API changes

Various API methods in `hdbconnect_async` now return `T` rather than `Result<T>`.

## [0.26.0] 2023-02-16

### API changes

Most Connection methods don't require mutability.

Introduce variants `HdbValue::DBSTRING` and `HdbError::Cesu8AsBytes`
for late handling of cesu8 errors. Late handling is important to ensure that reply-parsing
is always completed so that no data remain on the wire.

Re-export `serde_db`'s (de)serialization errors.

## [0.25.1] 2023-02-02

Fix READMEs.

## [0.25.0] 2023-02-02

Reorganize the project using three workspaces.

Add a sibling crate `hdbconnect_async`!!

Make `dist_tx` optional.

Make `r2d2_pool` an optional feature of the `sync` version.

Add an optional feature `rocket_pool` to the `async` version.

Minor, but some breaking API changes.

Improve test setup.

Fix authentication two byte length encoding.

- switch to serde_db 0.10
- remove dependency to chrono (chrono support for serde remains)

Implement implicit redirect (the server can trigger a redirect in case that e.g. an SMVR failover
has taken place). IS NOT YET TESTED!

## [0.23.0] 2020-12-29

Add redirect support: target database can be specified by name.

Some minor API smoothing (-> version bump):

- Connection::`get_database_name()`, `get_system_id()`, and `get_full_version_string()`,
  return `HdbResult<String>`, rather than `HdbResult<Option<String>>`
- ConnectParamsBuilder
  - `get_password` returns a `SecUtf8` instead of a `SecStr`
  - `get_options` is removed

## [0.22.2] 2020-11-22

Add support for array-type.

## [0.22.1] 2020-11-13

Minor improvements, code maintenance.

## [0.22.0] 2020-10-16

### API changes

Revise handling of ResultSetMetadata to make it much more ergonomic (and idiomatic).

- ResulSset now provides direct access to a `Vec<FieldMetadata>`, and
`FieldMetadata` exposes the metadata of each field.
- The type `ResultSetMetadata` with its awkward API is gone (-> version bump).

Update dependencies.

## [0.21.4] 2020-08-19

### Fixes and Improvements

Update dependencies.

## [0.21.3] 2020-05-18

## [0.21.0] 2020-04-08

### API changes

Simplify API of `OutputParameters`.

### Fixes and Improvements

Remove direct dependency to `serde_derive`.

Add test for using HANA's management console.

### Fixes and Improvements

Improve ease-of-use for lob objects by letting lob objects keep their result set core object
and their prepared statement core object alive until they are completely loaded.

## [0.20.4] 2020-03-02

### API extension

Add `Connection::client_info`.

## [0.20.3] 2020-02-28

includes all information except password.

Some code maintenance.

Add variant `ServerCerts::None` to use TLS without server validation.

## [0.20.0] 2020-01-31

Make `ResultsSet` thread-safe.

Add `IntoConnectParamsBuilder` and implementations for `&str` and `String` and `Url`.

## [0.19.0] 2020-01-16

### API changes

Make `Connection::new()` and `ConnectionManager::new()` more flexible by
taking a `P: IntoConnectParams` rather than a `ConnectParams`.

Improve `ConnectParamsBuilder`:

- move root-certificates option as an additional variant into ServerCerts enum
- don't erase any information from the `ConnectParamsBuilder` during build()

Make feature "tls" permanent - so it disappears from the list of cargo features!

### Fixes and Improvements

Remove redundant `ConnectParams` in `Connection` (it is in AmConnCore anyway).

Remove wrong debug asserts from lob_writer (adding to the fix for [issue 23]).

Implement `Display`, and derive `Debug`, for `ConnectParams`.

Fix pedantic clippies, and some docu.
